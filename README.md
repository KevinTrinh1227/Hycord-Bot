  Hycord is essentially a <strong>Discord python</strong> program that is targeted toward Java Minecraft players who play on Hypixel. This bot is an all-in-one easy-to-use/setup bot that allows anyone to have their own fully customizable bot. This bot uses numerous APIs such as <strong><a href="https://api.hypixel.net/" target="_blank">Hypixel</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://playerdb.co/" target="_blank">PlayerDB</a></strong> not only to retrieve player data but to also validate and allow users to verify/sync their accounts together. This is currently an active project that will continuously receive updates, changes, and bug fixes. So be on the lookup for <strong><a href="https://github.com/KevinTrinh1227/Hycord-Bot/commits/main" target="_blank">new updates</a></strong>.
